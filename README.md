Web Status Panel In Dart

A couple of configuration points. Firstly, you will need to set you own IP on the server (main.dart).

Secondly, depending on the version of Linux you are using on the system, you may need to open up the port through the
firewall software.T he current panel works cross-platform as it only relies on details exposed via the dart:io package.

More later :-)
